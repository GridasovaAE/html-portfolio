<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an environmental engineering graduate by profession and have extensive experience as a private tutor in math.
  My husband is a software developer and he explains to me all the technical topics that I don't understand.
  This motivates me to seek further education in the IT field.
  I have some experience as a web developer because I am taking an online course at "Udemy" and I am looking
  for a job where I can develop myself into a specialist.</p>

<p>In addition to my sound technical understanding, I already have the following basic knowledge:
  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript/jQuery, HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>NodeJS, MySQL</li>
    <li>Build & Release Tool: GIT</li>
  </ul>
</p>



<p>My strengths include a high level of commitment and motivation, initiative and absolute reliability.
  I am sure that I can be a valuable member of your friendly team.
  I am very much looking forward to the opportunity to introduce myself personally.</p>
